# INTELLIGENT-SURVEILLANCE-SYSTEM
INTELLIGENT SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM Consists of Motion Detection Which detects motion from live Camera and face recognition system for face authentication purpose. 
Steps to run "Final Intelligent surveillence system":

1.OPEN MATLAB AND GET INTO "Final Intelligent surveillence system" FOLDER
   RUN FINAL.M 

2.AFTER RUN "Intelligent surveillence system" WINDOW WILL OPEN 

3.NOW 1ST RUN "FACE RECOGNITION FOR SYSTEM"  AFTER CLICK ON THAT 
   FACE RECOGNITION PROCESS WILL START AFTER VALIDATION FACES WILL BE       RECOGNISED.

4.NOW 2ND RUN "MOTION DETECTION FOR SYSTEM" 
   how to use = after run click on START then frames in live detection will start to use motion    get any object and hold near camera so 
that it will detect the MOTION . 

   " WAIT FOR COUNTER TO REACH 50 " then only CLOSE  the window .
